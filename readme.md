# node-compat

> Easily enable your Node program to enforce Node version requirements.

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/node-compat.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-compat) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/transitive-bullshit/node-compat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/transitive-bullshit/node-compat) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

- **Super simple** to use.
- **Targeted at CLIs** that want to **maximize compatibility** without sacrificing JS features.
- Use **async / await** in older versions of node!
- **No complicated transpilation**.
- **No monkey-patching**.
- Single dependency with **~50 lines of code**.
- Optionally pin your node program to a **specific version** of node for extreme reproducibility.
- No more end-users complaining that your CLI doesn't support Node v4, v6, etc.
- Built with the secure and popular **[npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx)**.


## How it works

You require `node-compat` and give it a desired node semver [range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#ranges) (like `'>= 8'` or `'^6.0.0'`).

If the current process's node version satisfies that range, then `node-compat` returns without doing anything.

If the current process's node version does not satisfy that range, then `npx` is used to temporarily install the appropriate matching version of [node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node) from npm and re-run the current process as a subprocess using the target node executable. In this case, all commandline flags, environment variables, and stdio will be inherited from the current process. The child process will again run into `node-compat`, only this time it will continue executing your code normally because the version check is satisfied. Once the child process terminates, either due to successful completion or an error, `node-compat` will exit the parent process with the same exit code.

**Note**: it is recommended but not required for you to invoke `node-compat` at the very beginning of your program.
**Note**: `node-compat` requires an active internet connection for `npx` to install the correct version of node.


## Install

This module requires `node >= 4`.

```bash
npm install --save node-compat
```

## Usage

```js
const compat = require('node-compat')

compat({ node: '>= 8' })

// regular JS code using modern features here...
```


## API

### compat(opts)

Ensure the current Node process satisfies the given requirements.

#### opts

Type: `Object`
**Required**

#### opts.node

Type: `String`
**Required**

Required semver [range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#ranges) for the node `process.version`.

Examples:

```js
compat({ node: '>= 8' })
compat({ node: '^6' })
compat({ node: '9' })
compat({ node: '7.10.0' })
compat({ node: '4 || >=9 || 6.0.0 - 7.0.0' })
```
